                It’s been a very long road to the launch of CD Projekt RED’s Cyberpunk 2077. It was a road full of delays, good and bad PR, crunch, and anticipation as we’ve waited to see what the team’s latest marquee game will bring. Now the launch is almost finally here. More than that, it’s basically 100% confirmed. CD Projekt RED has announced that Cyberpunk 2077 has gone gold and will be ready to ship on its established November release date.
            </p>
            <p>
                CD Projekt RED announced the news on the Cyberpunk game Twitter on October 5, 2020. According to the tweet posted the morning of, Cyberpunk 2077 has officially “gone gold” and will be ready for its official release on November 19, 2020 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. That essentially means that a Version 1.0 master copy has been made and is ready for printing and distribution across the various platforms. This also comes after CD Projekt RED recently just made an appearance in a commercial that aired during the recent NBA Finals.

                Also interesting is that this announcement of Cyberpunk 2077 going gold comes almost immediately after it was also announced that CD Projekt RED would be engaging in crunch in the final weeks of production on Cyberpunk 2077. It is unknown where the six-day work weeks mentioned in the alleged emails on Bloomberg come in if the development work is done, but efforts in distribution are likely already underway if the “gold” copy of the game is ready.
            </p>
            <p >
                Regardless of the crunch, it seems as though it’s finally here. Cyberpunk 2077 is coming on November 19 - one of the most anticipated launches in the entire 2020 gaming calendar - and nothing is going to stop it. As we close in on the final days before Cyberpunk’s launch, stay tuned to for further news and updates leading up to it.

            <h3>Blog 2: Razer Seiren Mini USB microphone revealed during RazerCon 2020</h3>
            <address class="author"><a href="about.html">Haotian Xie</a></address>    
            <time datetime="2020-10-06" title="October 6, 2020">Oct 6,2020</time>
            <p>
                The Razer Seiren line of microphones has been in the market for years, offering streamers and other consumers in need of audio input an acceptable option in several different forms, from the Razer Seiren X to the Razer Seiren Elite. But Razer recognizes that the general market and even its own products can be a bit clunky. With that in mind, Razer is offering a new form factor version of its mic lineup in the form of the Razer Seiren Mini.         
            </p>
            <p>
                The Razer Seiren Mini was announced during the RazerCon 2020 keynote livestream on October 10, 2020. Coming in at a mere 6.4-inches-tall, the Seiren Mini is built to be small, but fully functional for studio mic and livestreaming needs. It features a supercardioid pickup pattern, a 14mm condenser capsule, built in shock mounts to reduce outside vibrations and sound, and it all comes in at less than a pound. For all of that, it will also come at a rather light price as well. The Razer Seiren Mini will launch on October 10, 2020 at a retail price of $49.99 on the Razer website and further Razer retailers.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Razer Seiren Mini is a solid-looking mic for the space-conscious streamer. With such a small and light design, streamers should be able to make it fit their gaming space no matter how cluttered it is. Moreover, the Razer Seiren Mini is said to feature a performance in line with industry standard products above its price, punching above its weight so to speak. If other products in the Razer mic lineup are just a bit too bulky or pricey, the Razer Seiren Mini might just be the economic solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                With an October 10 launch date, the Razer Seiren Mini is available today. Want more? Be sure to check out other announcements from the RazerCon 2020 lineup.
